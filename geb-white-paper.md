# GEB: A Complex Adaptive System Perceiving Reality


# Abstract

Current Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain systems, built upon single formal systems, commonly face issues of **perceptual closure** and **structural centralization**: on one hand, systems struggle to effectively perceive and respond to uncertainties in the external world; on the other hand, centralized account systems prevent users from autonomously controlling their assets and data, hindering the protection of **individual sovereignty** within the system.

To overcome this dilemma, **GEB** proposes a **closed-loop architecture** composed of three types of formal systems collaborating asynchronously. The system includes:
1.  A **Consensus Formal System** for rule validation and consensus writing, forming the execution basis for trusted code.
2.  A **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) mechanism** that breaks the centralized account structure, enabling users to directly control **state units** with private keys, achieving a direct mapping between individuals and the system.
3.  A **P/NP structure** that introduces task generation and verification mechanisms, endowing the system with the ability to perceive and judge uncertainties in the real world.

Furthermore, the Consensus Formal System acts as an intermediary among the three structures, validating individual ownership states on one hand, and writing the verified results from the perceptual system into the consensus state on the other, thereby achieving dynamic connectivity and structural synergy among humans, machines, and the real world.

Under this architecture, GEB can continuously handle external inputs in open environments, achieve feedback regulation and structural evolution, ultimately providing a feasible path towards constructing **Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)** with real-world perceptual capabilities.

# 1. Introduction: The Structural Dilemma of Single Formal Systems

In the current era of rapid development in Artificial Intelligence and blockchain, intelligent systems and consensus systems have made significant progress in computational performance and structural complexity. However, their underlying architectures still largely rely on the **single formal system paradigm**, exhibiting a significant lack of adaptability when dealing with complex real-world environments. We categorize the systemic obstacles caused by this underlying structural paradigm into two core problems: **perceptual closure** and **structural centralization**.

## 1.1 Manifestation: Limitations of AI and Blockchain Systems

This structural limitation is particularly evident in current mainstream AI and blockchain systems.

### Limitations of Artificial Intelligence Systems

Generative AI systems, represented by Large Language Models (`LLM`), are built upon the statistical distributions of static corpora. Although feedback capabilities have been initially introduced in recent years through mechanisms like Instruction Tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (`RLHF`), their overall structure remains confined within the semantic space defined by the training data, lacking dynamic coupling with the real environment:

* **Lack of Environmental Feedback Mechanism:** Input is loosely coupled with the training distribution, preventing the system from adjusting output paths based on real-world states.
* **Lack of Autonomous Validation Capability:** The model cannot intrinsically determine the truthfulness or practicality of its own output.
* **Lack of Structural Evolutionary Path:** Parameter updates and model adjustments rely on external, centralized retraining mechanisms.

Therefore, these systems are essentially predictive recombiners within closed symbolic systems, struggling to build structural mappings and feedback regulations with the real world.

### Limitations of Blockchain Systems

Although blockchain can achieve deterministic consensus and data immutability, it also faces structural obstacles in perceiving reality and supporting complex behaviors:

* **Closed On-Chain Rules:** Blockchain systems can only process on-chain data and cannot natively receive or interpret off-chain inputs, making dynamic coupling with the real environment difficult.
* **Reliance on External Oracle Systems:** Most current Decentralized Applications (`DApp`s) rely on third-party oracles to obtain off-chain data, but data not natively validated by blockchain consensus inherently lacks trustworthiness.
* **Lack of Structural Feedback Mechanism:** The on-chain execution process cannot be structurally adjusted based on task effectiveness, environmental changes, or user behavior. The system also cannot proactively correct behavior or evolve new response strategies at the rule level.

More critically, the unified management model of the **account system** exacerbates this structural closure trend: user assets are attached to a central account structure, preventing users from directly controlling their own state, thus hindering the realization of individual sovereignty within the system.

## 1.2 The Problem of Perceptual Closure: The Self-Referential Paradox of Single Formal Systems

The theoretical root of the aforementioned phenomena lies in the fact that modern computing systems are commonly built upon a **single formal system paradigm**. Such systems, centered around symbolic computation, rely on closed sets of rules for operation. Their representative model is the **Turing Machine**, proposed by Alan Turing in 1936—a mathematical model that abstracts the computation process into symbol manipulation to simulate any definable finite logical procedure.

The Turing Machine model laid the foundation for modern computation theory, demonstrating extremely high reliability and consistency when handling closed, decidable logical tasks. However, precisely because of its **structural closure**, the system's operation is always confined to internal rules and symbol spaces, lacking mechanisms for perceiving the external environment and dynamic feedback capabilities. This **inherent closure** constitutes the fundamental structural bottleneck of formal systems when facing the open world.

This structural limitation can be further traced back to **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**, proposed in 1931. These theorems state that in any consistent first-order formal system containing Peano arithmetic, there must exist propositions that are actually true but cannot be proven or disproven within the system itself. This conclusion reveals the dual boundaries of closed systems:

* **Inherent Incompleteness of the System:** Any sufficiently complex formal system contains propositions it cannot self-prove or self-refute; even if consistent, it is necessarily incomplete.
* **External Unperceivability of the System:** The system cannot step outside its own rule system to observe or determine the truthfulness of external inputs. A Turing machine cannot "be aware" of the environment in which it operates, nor can it interpret real-world states beyond its symbolic system.

Therefore, even with a complete internal logical structure, a closed formal system cannot construct a structural perception mechanism oriented towards the real world. Its response capability will ultimately be limited by its own boundaries; attempting to introduce external feedback mechanisms may potentially undermine its original consistency and self-coherence.

## 1.3 The Problem of Centralization: Structural Limitations of the Account Model

Besides perceptual closure, the single formal system paradigm also introduces another fundamental obstacle in its structural representation: systems commonly adopt a **centralized account structure**, making it difficult for users to directly control their own assets and data, leading to a **lack of individual sovereignty**.

Taking Ethereum as an example, its account model is built upon a unified global state tree. All user assets and contract states rely on this central structure for representation and invocation. While this model enhances the efficiency of contract interactions, it also brings deep structural centralization:

* Every asset transfer and state change is essentially an update to the global state.
* Users do not possess independent "ownership units" but rely on the representation of their account addresses within the global state.
* User control over assets depends on trusting the smart contract code and the results of its on-chain rule execution, rather than direct control over verifiable, structurally independent individual **state units**.

This design pattern weakens the user's structural existence within the system, making individual sovereignty and asset control dependent on the platform's continuous operation and rule execution, thereby forming a typical **structural centralization mechanism**.

# 2. GEB Theory: A Path Towards Complex Adaptive Systems

To break through the fundamental limitations of single formal systems regarding perceptual closure and structural centralization, **GEB** proposes a **closed-loop architecture** composed of **three types of formal systems**. This architecture, through asynchronous collaboration, enables the system to respond to real-world inputs, express user behavior, and achieve verifiable state updates, aiming to construct a **Complex Adaptive System (CAS)** with real-world perceptual capabilities.

A prototype of this structure can be observed in the Bitcoin system: the blockchain ledger serves as the rule execution layer, the **UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)** mechanism introduces a direct mapping of individual behavior and ownership, and the **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** mechanism, through a **P/NP structure**, converts real-world computational power into verifiable on-chain results. GEB further abstracts this into three collaboratively operating formal subsystems.

## 2.1 Consensus Formal System: The Execution Module for Trusted Code

This represents the core execution system, akin to Bitcoin's, typifying a rule-closed, structurally complete, and consensus-verifiable formal system. Its task is to maintain the internal consistency and verifiability of the system.

Exemplified by Bitcoin, this system achieves network-wide consistency and immutability of transaction history and network state through a decentralized ledger structure and proof-of-work validation. Its formal structure consists of two collaborating parts:

* **Transaction Validation Structure:** Responsible for verifying the individual ownership state recorded in UTXOs. Each transaction must verify that its inputs reference valid UTXOs and confirm the consistency of the signature with the corresponding public key, thereby ensuring the validity of the state update.
* **Blockchain Validation Structure:** Blocks composed of transaction data are linked chronologically, forming a unified, replicable chain structure. Each new block contains a set of transactions to be validated and their corresponding proof-of-work (Nonce). The system validates the legitimacy of the new block by confirming whether the Nonce meets the difficulty target.

This system possesses the following key characteristics:

* **Closure:** All state changes depend on on-chain data and preset rules, requiring no external input.
* **Verifiability:** Any node can independently verify the current state without relying on a central entity.
* **Reproducibility:** The system's execution path is unique, supporting the complete reconstruction of the entire history state.

Therefore, the Consensus Formal System provides a structural trust mechanism without central coordination, serving as the most fundamental execution platform for the Bitcoin network and the GEB architecture.

However, this system is inherently a closed formal system. Its perceptual capability is limited to on-chain states and rules; it cannot actively acquire or interpret inputs from the real world or human subjective intentions. Consequently, to build a CAS with real-world perceptual capabilities, the GEB architecture introduces the **HCI mechanism** and the **P/NP reality perception mechanism** on top of this foundation, forming a system closed-loop for open interaction.

## 2.2 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Mechanism: An Individual Mapping Structure for State Unit Control

To overcome the structural centralization problem brought by the account model, GEB introduces an **HCI mechanism** centered on the goal of "**decentralization of state ownership**". Its task is to construct a **1:1 verifiable mapping relationship** between user subjective behavior and state ownership, achieving structural expression of individual behavior and direct confirmation of account ownership.

In systems like Ethereum, the account model binds assets, permissions, and operations to a unified account structure, leading to the following structural limitations:

* State update paths depend on the account structure, forming points of execution concentration.
* Strong coupling of states among multiple users inhibits system concurrency and freedom of expression.
* Permission control is embedded within accounts, making it difficult to reflect individual differences and local control.

Bitcoin's **Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)** mechanism structurally breaks this centralized architecture, constituting a distributed form of HCI formal system:

* Each UTXO is an independent expression unit of asset state, representing a specific amount of Bitcoin.
* Each UTXO is bound to one or more public keys, with control belonging to the individual(s) possessing the corresponding private key(s).
* Users authorize transactions by signing with their private keys, forming peer-to-peer value transfer paths.
* Each UTXO can be considered a micro-formal system for HCI, independently recording value transfer and ownership changes.

The HCI mechanism defined by GEB is a systematic development of this structural feature: through **account deconstruction and state unit mapping**, users can directly control asset states using keys, thereby achieving the independence of individual behavioral expression and the sovereign guarantee of asset ownership.

## 2.3 P/NP Structure: From Task Generation to Reality Perception

In the paper "Is P Versus NP Formally Independent?", Scott Aaronson points out that the P vs NP problem might be formally independent in standard axiomatic systems (like `ZFC`), meaning it cannot be proven or disproven within a single closed formal system. This limitation reflects an inherent **structural asymmetry** between the processes of generation and verification.

Based on this understanding, the GEB system architecture explicitly proposes separating the generation and verification processes, establishing distinct **NP-type subsystems** oriented towards exploration and **P-type subsystems** oriented towards confirmation. This separation aims to achieve effective perception, verification, and feedback for complex real-world inputs.

Specifically, the GEB system delineates the following two core subsystems:

* **NP-type Generation System:** Responsible for receiving complex inputs from reality (e.g., task requests, preference expressions, subjective evaluations) and generating candidate behaviors through multi-path, distributed exploration. This process is highly uncertain and non-linear, making it difficult to predefine paths, thus representing a typical "hard to solve but easy to verify" structural problem.
* **P-type Verification System:** Responsible for structurally verifying candidate solutions under rule constraints, including computational judgment, logical constraints, structural scoring, etc. It features reproducible, consensus-achievable execution characteristics within polynomial time, making it a crucial component for achieving stable output and state writing in the system.

Connected asynchronously, these two subsystems form a **perception-verification structural closed loop** capable of continuously receiving external inputs, dynamically generating candidates, rapidly verifying them, and constantly updating its own state.

This mechanism not only possesses systemic validation capabilities but also carries a metaphor at the cognitive level for human cognition and the evolution of group consensus:

* When individuals face new problems, their cognitive process is often an uncertain and complex "solving" process, akin to finding a solution to an NP problem, potentially requiring extensive trial and error and non-linear thinking. However, when individual cognitive achievements are accepted by a social group and form cultural consensus, the "verification" of this knowledge, norms, and practices becomes relatively easy, similar to verifying a solution to a P problem. Once cultural consensus is formed, this knowledge can be efficiently disseminated and applied, further shaping new individual cognition.

This structural mechanism has a preliminary manifestation in the Bitcoin system. Under the `PoW` consensus mechanism, miners act as distributed agents, using real-world resources (like electricity) for intensive hash searching to find a Nonce satisfying the difficulty target, constituting a typical NP-type exploration process. The system then rapidly verifies the validity of the solution using preset rules and writes it into the consensus state, completing the P-type confirmation. The entire network absorbs the verified results through the longest chain consensus mechanism, achieving state updates and security maintenance.

GEB generalizes this structure from block-level state construction to a broader system of real-world tasks, including task generation, behavior scoring, preference feedback, and resource incentives. Due to the inherent asymmetry and non-linear feedback between NP and P, this mechanism not only enhances the system's responsiveness to real-world inputs but also allows **structural preferences and value orders** that transcend formal rules to emerge during system collaboration and evolution.

## 2.4 From a Single System to Three Types of Systems: Structural Evolution

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3734836-151b-448a-b862-b0a80b5b9ebb)


Traditional blockchain systems (like Ethereum) are built solely upon closed execution systems. The account model uniformly manages assets and permissions, external data relies on oracle injections, and they lack structural mapping for user behavior and reality perception capabilities. Despite possessing near Turing completeness, their structural paradigm still belongs to that of a **single formal system**, making it difficult to form a feedback loop oriented towards reality.

GEB introduces three functionally decoupled formal subsystems on this basis:
* **(A) Consensus Formal System:** Responsible for rule validation and state writing.
* **(B) Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Mechanism:** Replaces the account structure with decentralized state units, guaranteeing verifiable expression of individual behavior.
* **(C) P/NP Structure:** Handles uncertain tasks from real-world inputs and completes structural verification.

These three collaborate to form a system closed loop with input, mapping, and validation capabilities.

Among them, the **Consensus Formal System (A)** serves as the crucial intermediary: it both validates the state units controlled by users, ensuring on-chain confirmation of individual actions, and writes the external inputs verified by the P/NP system, transforming real-world perception results into consensus state.

This verification mechanism makes the Consensus Formal System not just an execution foundation but also a **structural bridge connecting humans, machines, and the real world**. It enables asynchronous connectivity and collaborative updates between systems, laying the groundwork for building a Complex Adaptive System with real-world perceptual capabilities.

# 3. Paradigm Leap: From BEVM(λ) to GEB

The three-type formal subsystem structure proposed by GEB aims to systematically address the limitations of single systems in terms of perceptual closure and structural centralization. This design is not conceived in a vacuum but represents a structural evolution based on the **BEVM(λ)** framework.

`BEVM(λ)` is the predecessor framework on this evolutionary path. Its design focused on characterizing the underlying logical structure of Bitcoin using formal systems, abstracting the following four core elements:

* **λ-calculus:** As the modeling language for state transitions and rule expression.
* **Individual model:** Used to characterize the one-to-one mapping between user intent and state ownership.
* **Consensus algorithm:** To ensure system state validation and network-wide consistency.
* **Consensus perception mechanism:** An attempt to map off-chain energy input to on-chain value writing.

While this structure offered significant theoretical insights, it faced two major issues in practical engineering applications: firstly, the structure was overly abstract, lacking deployable modular interfaces; secondly, interaction mechanisms between system components were absent, making it difficult to form a complete input-feedback-evolution closed loop.

To address these issues, GEB restructured the four core components of `BEVM(λ)`, mapping them into three types of collaboratively operating formal subsystems, thereby completing the paradigm shift from abstract theory to engineering architecture:

* First, **λ-calculus** and the **consensus algorithm** were integrated into the **Consensus Formal System**, focusing on state validation and rule execution as the infrastructure for system consistency, no longer handling external inputs.
* Second, the **Individual model** was expanded into the **HCI Mechanism**. Through structures like `UTXO`, it achieves a 1:1 mapping between individuals and state ownership, thereby replacing the centralized account model and ensuring users' direct control over their assets and actions.
* Finally, the **consensus perception mechanism** was systematized into the **P/NP Structure**, designed to receive uncertain task inputs from the real world. By generating candidate solutions and performing structural verification, it enables the system to respond effectively to the external environment.

These three components form a structural closed loop through asynchronous collaboration, allowing the GEB system to process real-world inputs, verify their validity, and update its state within an open environment. The Consensus Formal System acts as the core intermediary, responsible for both validating individual ownership states and writing the verified outputs of the perception system into the consensus state.

Therefore, GEB is not merely an extension or parameter upgrade of `BEVM(λ)` but a **paradigm evolution from formal modeling to a structural closed loop**. Its core lies not in enhancing the system's internal expressive power, but in constructing a **Complex Adaptive System** with real-world perceptual capabilities.

# 4. GEB System Architecture: A Structurally Closed-Loop Design Based on Heterogeneous Collaboration

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc240d93-8da3-4668-8790-1c129dfc6392)


Building upon the theoretical foundations established in the previous chapters, this chapter systematically reconstructs the BitAgere mechanism from the original `BEVM(λ)` architecture. Unlike the layered "mother consensus-child consensus" design of the old architecture, GEB integrates it into a unified **heterogeneous collaborative network** composed of multiple **Agere subsystems**. This network revolves around four key stages: **task generation—human-computer interaction—structural verification—state writing**, aiming to achieve the system's responsiveness to real-world inputs and its capacity for structural evolution.

The overall architecture of GEB, as illustrated (figure assumed), consists of a consensus layer, an upper adjudication module **Agere0**, and multiple functionally heterogeneous Agere subsystems. The **Consensus Formal System** is responsible for the global distribution of GEB tokens and state writing. **Agere0**, as the sole adjudicator subsystem, evaluates the HCI behavior within other subsystems using a structured scoring function (potentially **PoHCI** - Proof of Human-Computer Interaction) and determines the cross-system token allocation ratios accordingly. Each **Agere subsystem** operates facing specific types of real-world tasks, with internal **staked miners** responsible for task execution and mutual scoring, completing local incentive distribution.

Miners in the system are categorized into two types based on their stake: **LBTC staked miners** exclusively participate in Agere0's behavioral evaluation, while **GEB staked miners** are distributed across various subsystems executing tasks and providing mutual feedback. The incentive mechanism employs a two-tiered structure: the system preference output by Agere0 determines the resource allocation weights from the main chain to each subsystem, and each subsystem then performs fine-grained token distribution internally based on miner scores.

The operational mechanism of every Agere subsystem relies on the collaborative completion by the three types of formal systems defined in the previous chapters: the **P/NP structure** is used to receive uncertain tasks and generate candidate solutions, the **HCI mechanism** establishes a 1:1 mapping between individuals and ownership states, and the **Consensus Formal System** is used for rule validation and structural state writing, ultimately achieving a responsive closed loop for real-world tasks.

## 4.1 Agere 0: The Adjudication Mechanism for Task Evaluation and System Feedback

### 4.1.1 Perceptual Symbiosis: System Connection Anchored to Bitcoin

To achieve connectivity between the GEB system and the Bitcoin network, Agere 0, as the upper adjudication module of the BitAgere network, introduces a **non-invasive connection structure**. Its core mechanism involves screening eligible users through self-custodial **LBTC staking** within the Lightning Network, establishing an **interactive bridge** that is mutually perceptive with the Bitcoin ecosystem but remains structurally independent.

Here, staking serves only as an entry threshold. The scoring weights and allocation mechanisms are designed independently of the stake size to prevent centralized scoring bias and encourage balanced network participation.

### 4.1.2 Scoring Mechanism: Usability Assessment Centered on Human-Computer Interaction

Agere0's core responsibility is to perform structured scoring of the task execution processes within various Agere subsystems, measuring the **usability** of their HCI behavior. This scoring process integrates three categories of input metric systems:

* **Basic Interaction Metrics (B)**: Reflect fundamental structural characteristics of user-system interaction, such as frequency, depth, and data complexity.
    * ![B_dur](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20B_%7Bdur%7D): Interaction frequency, the total number of interactions a user has with a specific Agere system.
    * ![B_dep](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20B_%7Bdep%7D): Interaction depth, reflecting the contextual breadth and logical complexity of each task.
    * ![B_in_vol](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20B_%7B\text{in\_vol}%7D): Input volume, e.g., text length, size of uploaded data.
    * ![B_out_vol](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20B_%7B\text{out\_vol}%7D): Output quantity or complexity, e.g., word count of generated results, number of structures.
* **Behavioral Quality Metrics (Q)**: Reflect subjective evaluations and execution quality of task results by users and the system.
    * ![Q_succ_user](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20Q_%7B\text{succ\_user}%7D): User task success rate. For Agere services with clear objectives, did the user successfully receive feedback? User feedback is required.
    * ![Q_succ_agere](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20Q_%7B\text{succ\_agere}%7D): Agere 0 task success rate. For Agere services with clear objectives, Agere 0 participants need to provide feedback.
* **Contextual Factor Metrics (C)**: Introduce long-term behavior and exploratory features to reflect non-linear interaction patterns.
    * ![C_hist](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20C_%7Bhist%7D): Historical behavior factor, measuring the stability of a user's long-term, high-quality interactions.
    * ![C_expl](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20C_%7Bexpl%7D): Exploratory factor, assessing whether the user actively proposes new questions or tests boundaries, driving the evolution of system behavior.

**Comprehensive Scoring Model**

Scores from the three categories are fused using main category weights (![W_Basic](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20W_%7BBasic%7D), ![W_Quality](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20W_%7BQuality%7D), ![W_Context](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20W_%7BContext%7D)) to calculate the system structural score:

![Score Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20Score%20%3D%20W_%7BBasic%7D%20%5Ccdot%20Score_%7BBasic%7D%20%2B%20W_%7BQuality%7D%20%5Ccdot%20Score_%7BQuality%7D%20%2B%20W_%7BContext%7D%20%5Ccdot%20Score_%7BContext%7D)

Where the main category weights satisfy the normalization constraint:

![Weights Constraint](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20W_%7BBasic%7D%20%2B%20W_%7BQuality%7D%20%2B%20W_%7BContext%7D%20%3D%201)

## 4.2 Agere System Network: Task-Based Real-World Feedback Closed-Loop Structure

Each Agere subsystem undertakes a category of real-world perception tasks and operates collaboratively based on the three types of formal systems proposed in the GEB architecture, constructing a structural feedback closed loop from external input to consensus state updates.

Specifically, the entire closed-loop operational flow can be divided into four core stages:

1.  **Task Generation (NP-type Structure)**
    Users submit problems, data, or target requests with inherent uncertainty. These inputs typically lack predefined solutions achievable in a short time, constituting the structural expression of NP-type problems. Examples include environmental deviation detection, content recommendation, target response strategy selection, etc.

2.  **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI Mechanism)**
    User actions are mapped to state units via key control, forming a 1:1 verifiable mapping relationship between humans and the system. This ensures that interaction behaviors have identity attribution, state binding, and accountability traceability.

3.  **Structural Verification (P-type Structure)**
    For each task candidate solution, the system organizes validators (who can be other users, Agents, or system modules) to participate in scoring and feedback. Each validator ![i](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20i) submits their subjective score ![w_ij](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20w_%7Bij%7D) for candidate solution ![j](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20j), along with their corresponding stake amount ![s_i](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20s_i). This process constitutes the structural verification input for the NP-type task results.

    To transform these subjective scores into a consensus-achievable structural preference for state writing, GEB introduces a **probabilistic structural selection mechanism** based on `BEVM(λ)`, forming a non-linear feedback path from scoring to unique writing:

    * **Consensus Score Aggregation:** Use a stake-weighted median mechanism to extract the system's acceptable preference from the scoring matrix:
      ![Consensus Score Aggregation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Cbar%7Bw%7D_j%20%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B%20%5Cmax%20%5CBigl%5C%7B%5C%2Cw%20%5C%3B%5CBig%7C%5C%3B%20%5Csum_i%5Cbigl%5Bs_i%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cmathbf%7BI%7D(w_%7Bij%7D%20%5Cge%20w)%5Cbigr%5D%5C%3B%5Cge%5C%3B%5Ckappa%20%5Ccdot%20%5Csum_i%20s_i%20%5CBigr%5C%7D)
      (where ![Indicator Function](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Cmathbf%7BI%7D%28%5Ccdot%29) is the indicator function and ![kappa](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Ckappa) is a threshold parameter, e.g., 0.5 for median).

    * **Score Smoothing Mechanism:** Smoothly combine original scores with the consensus score to suppress interference from extreme values:
      ![Score Smoothing](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Ctilde%7Bw%7D_%7Bij%7D%20%5C%3B%3D%5C%3B%20%281-%5Cbeta%29%5C%2Cw_%7Bij%7D%5C%3B%2B%5C%3B%5Cbeta%5C%2C%5Cbar%7Bw%7D_j)
      (where ![beta](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Cbeta) is a smoothing factor).

    * **Consensus Weight Distribution:** Calculate the acceptance probability ![p_j](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20p_j) for candidate solution ![j](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20j) based on the smoothed scores and stakes:
      ![Consensus Weight Distribution](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20p_j%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%20%5Cbigl%28s_i%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ctilde%7Bw%7D_%7Bij%7D%5Cbigr%29%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bk%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%20%5Cbigl%28s_i%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ctilde%7Bw%7D_%7Bik%7D%5Cbigr%29%7D)

    * **Consensus Solution Selection Mechanism:** The system samples a unique solution ![j*](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20j%5E%2A) from the candidate set according to probabilities ![p_j](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20p_j), serving as the state writing object for the current round:
      ![Consensus Solution Selection](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20j%5E%2A%20%5Csim%20%5Ctext%7BCategorical%7D%28p_1%2C%20p_2%2C%20%5Cdots%2C%20p_n%29)

    This mechanism essentially constructs a structural P/NP verification path analogous to Bitcoin's `PoW`: multiple task candidate solutions serve as "hard-to-solve but verifiable" NP inputs, are verified through scoring to construct a P-type structure, and finally written to the on-chain state via structural sampling, forming a unique consensus result. Unlike linear feedback averaging, GEB's probabilistic selection mechanism ensures that highly-rated solutions have priority while preserving the system's exploratory and evolutionary space, building a feedback loop with greater interference resistance and evolutionary potential.

4.  **On-Chain Writing (Consensus Formal System)**
    The final result is written to the on-chain state in a structured data format, constituting the system's behavioral outcome for the current phase and serving as input for subsequent phases involving task generation, preference adjustment, resource reallocation, etc.

This chapter, based on the theories from the first three chapters, systematically reconstructs the structural closed-loop design of GEB. From Agere0's usability assessment mechanism to the complete process of task generation, structural scoring, and state writing within Agere subsystems, GEB constructs a Complex Adaptive System equipped with capabilities for real-world input response, behavioral feedback, and state evolution.

# 5. Application Example and Analysis of the GEB Architecture

Chapter 4 systematically elaborated on the core architecture of GEB—a collaborative network composed of the **Agere0** adjudication module and multiple functionally heterogeneous **Agere subsystems**. It detailed the "Task Generation (NP)—Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)—Structural Verification (P)—State Writing (Blockchain)" workflow integrated throughout. The core objective of this architecture is to empower the system with the ability to effectively handle real-world uncertainties, safeguard individual sovereignty, and achieve adaptive evolution.

To specifically demonstrate how the GEB architecture translates these design principles and core mechanisms into capabilities for solving practical problems, this chapter selects an **autonomous driving system with real-world perception capabilities** as a case study.

This case focuses on the complexity of physical world interaction. We will theoretically explore how the GEB architecture utilizes its **P/NP structure** to perceive and adapt to environmental uncertainties, and how it employs the **HCI mechanism** to delineate human-vehicle rights and responsibilities, aiming to break through the bottlenecks of perceptual closure and liability definition in existing autonomous driving solutions.

Through a detailed exposition of this case, this chapter aims to further validate the universality and effectiveness of the GEB architecture from an application perspective, clarifying the specific roles and values of its key components (such as the P/NP structure, HCI mechanism, consensus, and incentive design).

## 5.1 Case Study: Autonomous Driving System with Real-World Perception Capabilities

Current mainstream autonomous driving solutions typically rely on high-definition maps, multi-sensor fusion, and complex control algorithms. However, this architecture suffers from structural centralization and perceptual closure issues in its design, leading to the following significant shortcomings when dealing with complex and ever-changing real-world traffic environments:

* **Insufficient Timeliness of Map Updates:** The update frequency and coverage of centralized maps struggle to match real-world changes in real-time.
* **Limitations of Perception Systems:** Perception is limited to the vehicle's own sensors, resulting in vague information about the distant environment. Perception capabilities significantly degrade in adverse weather, occlusions, etc., making it difficult to fully grasp complex traffic scenarios.
* **Ambiguity of Safety Responsibility:** The decoupling of vehicle ownership and driving behavior makes liability difficult to define.

To overcome these problems, we propose constructing the next generation of autonomous driving systems based on the design principles of GEB's three types of formal systems. The core ideas of this proposal include the following three aspects:

1.  **Human-Vehicle Binding via GEB's HCI Mechanism:** Each individual controls the usage rights and data ownership of their vehicle by holding its unique key. This model achieves sovereign protection of individual vehicle assets and personalized management of driving behavior, laying the foundation for data privacy protection, liability tracing, etc.
2.  **Traffic Environment Perception based on P/NP Structure:** Each moving vehicle acts as a "miner" executing driving tasks guided by a world navigation map. The vehicle's perception system constantly compares actual road conditions with the global navigation map, attempting to identify discrepancies (data differences). This process is highly uncertain and non-linear, lacking predefined paths, representing a typical **NP problem**. Other vehicles on the same road segment perform similar operations, each generating discrepancy data. When a sufficient number of vehicles perceive the same discrepancy data, this data is verified by the consensus mechanism and added to the consensus as a "new fact."
3.  **World Navigation Map Construction using Consensus Formal System:** These "new fact" data points are continuously submitted to the global consensus formal system, constructing a dynamic navigation map that adapts to real-world changes. This decentralized mechanism, collectively maintained and updated by all participants, ensures the map's real-time accuracy, precision, and robustness.

Applying this proposal to the autonomous driving domain undoubtedly faces significant technical challenges, such as real-time requirements, data throughput demands, and privacy protection. Nevertheless, based on the GEB architectural concepts, this proposal offers a new direction for the future development of adaptive autonomous driving systems. According to this scheme, we can potentially build a safer, more reliable, and more intelligent autonomous driving ecosystem, ultimately achieving truly driverless transportation.

# 6. Conclusion

This paper addresses the structural limitations of single formal systems concerning **perceptual closure** and **structural centralization** by proposing a Complex Adaptive System architecture named **GEB**. GEB is composed of three types of formal systems:
1.  The **Consensus Formal System** handles rule validation, ensuring system consistency and trustworthiness.
2.  The **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) mechanism** enables a direct mapping between user behavior and state ownership, safeguarding individual asset control.
3.  The **P/NP structure** manages task generation and verification, equipping the system with real-world perception capabilities.

In terms of engineering structure, GEB utilizes a unified architecture comprising **Agere0** and multiple heterogeneous **Agere subsystems** that collaboratively complete the entire process from real-world perception to state updates. Agere0 adjudicates the effectiveness of other subsystems and integrates closely with the Bitcoin network. Other Agere subsystems target specific tasks, forming structured decisions through mutual evaluation mechanisms, thereby driving continuous system state evolution.

Finally, the paper uses the **autonomous driving system** case study to further illustrate the cross-domain adaptability of the GEB architecture and validates the theory's clear implementation path and feasibility in practical engineering contexts.
