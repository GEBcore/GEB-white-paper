# GEB: A Complex Adaptive System for Perceiving Reality

# **Abstract**

Current artificial intelligence and blockchain systems, rooted in the single formal system paradigm represented by "computable Turing machines," universally face the dual dilemma of **perceptual closure** and **structural centralization**. They are unable to effectively perceive and respond to external environments, while also lacking individual sovereignty and decentralized arbitration mechanisms, thus necessitating reliance on centralized authority.

This paper identifies the theoretical root of this dilemma in Gödel's incompleteness. To transcend this limitation, we return to Alan Turing's profound insights in his doctoral dissertation and propose a **GEB Four-Element Theory** aimed at addressing `Π₂`-level challenges. This theory integrates Turing's two key ideas: the "**Oracle Turing Machine**" for introducing external judgments, and "**Transfinite Iteration Based on Ordinal Logic**" for constructing decentralized trust.

This four-element architecture, through the combination of **individual accounts** and **transfinite iteration** (longest chain consensus), ensures the system's complete decentralization; simultaneously, through the synergy between **Oracle Turing Machine** (emerging in the form of "perceivers") and **Computable Turing Machine**, it achieves the "judgment" and "verification" of reality.

Ultimately, GEB theory not only provides a unified perspective for understanding Bitcoin's essence, but more importantly, it offers profound theoretical insights and engineering blueprints for constructing the next generation of complex adaptive systems capable of continuous evolution and genuine reality perception.

# 1. Introduction: The Structural Dilemma of Single Formal Systems

In today's rapidly developing artificial intelligence and blockchain landscape, while both technologies have made significant progress in their respective domains, their underlying architectures remain long constrained by the **single formal system** paradigm. This paradigm exposes profound adaptive defects when facing the complex real world, which we categorize as two structural dilemmas: **perceptual closure** and **structural centralization**.

Essentially, this limitation stems from the theoretical incompleteness of closed computational models represented by Turing machines. They cannot independently support a complex adaptive system capable of dynamic interaction with the environment. Blockchain, as a typical implementation of this paradigm, while its inherent closure ensures internal state verifiability, sacrifices the ability to perceive and respond to the real world—this is the fundamental reason for its application deployment difficulties.

## 1.1 Phenomenological Manifestation: Limitations of AI and Blockchain Systems

This structural limitation is particularly evident in current mainstream artificial intelligence systems and blockchain systems.

### Limitations of AI Systems

Generative AI systems represented by Large Language Models (LLMs) are built upon statistical distributions of static corpora. Although feedback capabilities have been preliminarily introduced through mechanisms such as Instruction Tuning and Human Feedback Reinforcement Learning (RLHF) in recent years, their overall structure remains closed within the semantic space defined by training data, lacking dynamic coupling with the real environment:

- **Lack of environmental feedback mechanisms**: Input is loosely coupled with training distributions, and systems cannot adjust output paths based on real-world states;
- **Lack of autonomous verification capabilities**: Models cannot endogenously judge the authenticity or utility of their own outputs;
- **Lack of structural evolution paths**: Parameter updates and model adjustments rely on external centralized retraining mechanisms.

Therefore, such systems are essentially **predictive recombiners in closed symbolic systems**, making it difficult to construct structural mappings and feedback regulation of the real world.

### Limitations of Blockchain Systems

While blockchain can achieve deterministic consensus and data tamper-resistance, it also faces structural obstacles in perceiving reality and supporting complex behaviors:

- **Closed on-chain rules**: Blockchain systems can only process on-chain data and cannot natively receive or interpret off-chain inputs, making it difficult to achieve dynamic coupling with the real environment;
- **Dependence on external oracle systems**: Most current DApps rely on third-party oracles to obtain off-chain data, but data not validated by native blockchain consensus essentially lacks credibility.
- **Lack of structural feedback mechanisms**: On-chain execution processes cannot structurally adjust based on task effectiveness, environmental changes, or user behavior, nor can the system actively correct behaviors or evolve new response strategies at the rule level.

More critically, the unified management model of the account system amplifies this structural closure trend: user assets are attached to centralized account structures, preventing direct control over their own states, making individual sovereignty difficult to achieve in the system.

## 1.2 Perceptual Closure Problem: Incompleteness of Single Formal Systems

The theoretical root of the above phenomena lies in the fact that modern computational systems are universally built upon a **single formal system paradigm**. Such systems take symbolic calculus as their core, relying on closed rule sets for computation, with the representative model being the Turing machine proposed by Alan Turing in 1936—a mathematical model that abstracts computational processes as symbolic operations, used to simulate any definable finite logical program.

The Turing machine model laid the foundation for modern computational theory, demonstrating extremely high reliability and consistency when processing closed, decidable logical tasks. However, precisely due to its structural closure, the system's operation is always confined to **internal rules and symbolic spaces**, lacking perceptual mechanisms and dynamic feedback capabilities for external environments. This endogenous closure constitutes the basic structural bottleneck of formal systems when facing the open world.

This structural limitation can be further traced back to the incompleteness theorem proposed by Gödel in 1931. This theorem states that in any first-order formal system containing Peano arithmetic and maintaining self-consistency, there necessarily exist some propositions—**the system itself cannot prove their truth or falsity, yet they are actually true**. This conclusion reveals the dual boundaries of closed systems:

- **Intrinsic incompleteness of systems**: Any sufficiently complex formal system has propositions it cannot prove or disprove; even if the system is self-consistent, it is destined to be incomplete;
- **External imperceptibility of systems**: Systems cannot jump out of their own rule systems to observe or judge the authenticity of external inputs. Turing machines cannot "consciousness" the environment they operate in, nor can they interpret real-world states beyond their symbolic systems.

Thus, even single formal systems with complete internal computational capabilities cannot achieve structural perception and evolutionary response to the real world. The computable paradigm represented by Turing machines naturally lacks the ability to handle uncertainty and dynamic feedback in open systems.

Blockchain systems, as typical representatives of **single computable formal systems**, while their rule closure enhances system consistency and verifiability, also means **they cannot independently achieve structural perception and complex adaptation of the real world**. This is the theoretical root of blockchain's difficulty in perceiving reality.

## 1.3 Centralization Problem: Structural Limitations of Account Models

Beyond perceptual closure, single formal systems also trigger another fundamental obstacle in structural expression: systems universally adopt centralized account structure organization methods, preventing users from directly controlling their own assets and data, leading to the loss of individual sovereignty.

Taking Ethereum as an example, its account model is built upon a unified global state tree, with all user assets and contract states depending on this centralized structure for expression and invocation. While this model improves contract interaction efficiency, it also brings deep centralization at the structural level:

- Every asset transfer and state change is essentially an update to the global state;
- Users do not own independent "ownership" units, but rather rely on the expression of account addresses in the global state;
- Users' control over assets depends on trust in smart contract code and on-chain rule execution results, rather than direct control over verifiable, structurally independent individual state units.

This design pattern weakens users' structural existence in the system, making individual sovereignty and asset control capabilities dependent on the platform's continuous operation and rule execution, thus forming a typical structural centralization mechanism.

# 2. GEB Theory: The Path to Complex Adaptive Systems

This chapter elucidates the core theory of the GEB system, which is a **GEB Four-Element Theory** aimed at addressing `Π₂`-level challenges. The intellectual source of this theory is Alan Turing's two revolutionary tools for transcending Gödel's "cognitive boundaries"—the "**Oracle Turing Machine**" for introducing external judgments, and "**Transfinite Iteration Based on Ordinal Logic**" for constructing trust.

## 2.1 The Challenge of Π₂ Propositions: Theoretical Origins and Engineering Mapping

### 2.1.1 Theoretical Origins: From Gödel, Turing to Feferman

Any theory attempting to construct complex adaptive systems must respond to its logical starting point—the incompleteness theorem proposed by Kurt Gödel in 1931. This theorem reveals that any closed system based on fixed rules has "cognitive boundaries"—there are always truths within that cannot be self-proven, thus the upper limit of capabilities is predetermined. How to transcend this fundamental limitation of static systems has become the core challenge of modern computational theory.

Alan Turing provided a revolutionary response in his 1939 doctoral dissertation "Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals": he conceived an open system capable of continuous evolution, with two core mechanisms: "**Oracle Machine**" and "**Transfinite Iteration Based on Ordinal Logic**."

However, Turing's conception was more like a profound philosophical blueprint at the time. Decades later, logician Solomon Feferman, through his research on "transfinite series of theories," gave Turing's dynamic evolution process strict mathematical form. Feferman's formalization work ultimately revealed the true goal of Turing's architecture: its capabilities precisely correspond to handling a class of logically profound problems, namely "**Π₂ propositions**."

### 2.1.2 The Connotation of Π₂ Propositions: Verifiability and Non-computability

The general form of Π₂ propositions is:

$$
(∀x)(∃y) R(x, y)
$$

This formula precisely characterizes a class of "promises about the future." At its core is a **mechanically verifiable relation R(x, y)**, which guarantees that, for any specific "challenge" x, the validity of a "candidate solution" y can be determined in a finite number of steps.

The true difficulty of this structure lies in the fact that while for every x, the solution y is asserted to exist (∃y), and this promise is universal (∀x), we **cannot use a unified, universal algorithm** to input any x and automatically compute the corresponding y. In computability theory, this means the mapping from x to y is not a "computable function."

Therefore, Π₂ propositions represent a class of profound problems that transcend the capabilities of any single closed algorithm. They assert the existence of solutions without providing unified solution methods, which is precisely the challenge that requires open, evolving, and even "oracle"-assisted approaches to address.

### 2.1.3 Engineering Mapping: Bitcoin's Core Π₂ Problem

This abstract theoretical challenge finds perfect engineering mapping in Bitcoin's design. The core problem Bitcoin aims to solve is: **How to ensure that any legitimate transaction will ultimately be accepted and confirmed by the network under the premise of no centralized arbitration?** This problem can be formally expressed as a Π₂ proposition:

$$
(∀tx)(∃block) R(tx, block)
$$

Where:

- ∀tx: represents **any** future legitimate transaction that may appear.
- ∃block: asserts that **there necessarily exists a** block containing this transaction as the "solution" for its acceptance by the network.
- R(tx, block): represents a **efficiently verifiable** relation, namely "tx is legitimately included in block, and block conforms to network consensus rules (i.e., longest chain principle)."

Anyone can easily verify whether a given block legitimately contains tx. But no centralized algorithm can "pre-compute" what the future block containing tx will look like. Its emergence depends on decentralized miners as "oracles" in open competition. Therefore, the Bitcoin system is essentially an engineering attempt to handle Π₂-level problems, which must rely on an open, continuously evolving structure to expand its boundaries of trust and verification.

## 2.2 Oracle Turing Machine: Theoretical Model for Perceiving Reality

Section 2.1 establishes from the perspective of mathematical logic that open, evolving systems are necessary approaches for addressing Π₂-level challenges. The precise theoretical model for such systems is the **Oracle Turing Machine** proposed by Alan Turing in his 1939 doctoral dissertation. The **Oracle Turing Machine** is not merely a theoretical tool, but the cornerstone for our understanding of the core cognitive process of "perceiving reality."

There are two key models in Turing's intellectual development, corresponding to two different types of problems: first, the **Standard Turing Machine (1936)**, which defines the theoretical core of **computers**, aimed at solving "computable problems" with deterministic answers within closed systems; second, the **Oracle Turing Machine (1939)**, aimed at handling "**decision problems**" that require external system information for judgment and selection. "Perceiving reality"—for example, judging whether an object is an apple—is essentially the latter. It cannot be derived solely from logical axioms, but must rely on some external "intuition" or "judgment." Therefore, any system attempting to perceive reality must have the Oracle Turing Machine as its theoretical model, which we can call its engineering implementation **Perceiver**.

The profundity of the Oracle Turing Machine lies in its effective separation of cognitive tasks, which precisely utilizes the asymmetry between "solution generation" and "solution verification" in computational complexity theory. Its working principle is: delegate "decision or generation" tasks requiring vast search spaces and external information to the "oracle" black box; the system itself focuses on fast, deterministic rule verification of "candidate solutions" submitted by the oracle.

In Bitcoin, this decentralized complex system, this theoretical model finds ingenious engineering implementation. The "oracle" is not an omniscient entity; rather, it emerges through competitive social collaboration, represented by three types of external actors who perform "work" and provide "judgments" in distinct ways:

1. **Users (Ownership Oracle)**: Through the act of private key signing, they make "judgments" about asset ownership. For the system, verifying the authenticity of a signature is very simple, but deriving the private key from the public key is extremely difficult. Users' signatures are external "assertions" that the system cannot compute on its own, but can only accept and verify.
2. **Miners (Block Generation Oracle)**: Through investing massive physical computing power (PoW) to compete for accounting rights, they make "judgments" about the order and validity of countless transactions in the network. Finding a hash value (Nonce) satisfying specific difficulty requires massive trial-and-error solving behavior, while any node can easily verify the result.
3. **Node Network (Path Evolution Oracle)**: Through broadcasting and synchronizing blocks in the network, they collectively promote the non-deterministic evolution of consensus paths. Although individual node behavior rules are simple, the macroscopic path ultimately forming a unique "longest chain" is unpredictable. This finally emerged path is the "judgment" made by the network as a whole, while verifying which chain is longest is a simple comparison problem.

These three types of "relative oracles" work synergistically, collectively constituting Bitcoin's Oracle Turing Machine model, continuously providing the system with external "judgments" about ownership, transaction order, and consensus paths that it cannot generate on its own. This overall design enables Bitcoin to structurally complete the paradigm shift from "system self-solving" to "accepting external input and verification." It does not introduce some form of centralized control, but truly achieves the system boundary of "open perceptual input, closed rule verification" through distributed, competitive oracle behaviors.

## 2.3 Transfinite Iteration Based on Ordinal Logic: Evolutionary Ladder for Building Oracle Trust

Section 2.2 elucidates that Oracle Turing Machines can provide external "judgments" for systems, but this immediately raises a deeper question: when multiple, even conflicting oracle judgments exist (for example, two miners simultaneously mining blocks), how should the system choose and establish "trust" in a specific history?

Turing's answer to this is not a one-time final arbitration, but another core conception in his doctoral dissertation, a dynamic evolutionary framework called "**Ordinal Logic**." The construction method of this framework—**Transfinite Iteration**—no longer treats "trust" as an endpoint that can be achieved instantly, but defines it as a structured process that can be continuously consolidated through infinite evolution.

The core steps are as follows: a formal system S_α, with the help of an **oracle**, recognizes a truth it cannot prove itself (for example, "S_α itself is consistent"); subsequently, the system absorbs this new truth as an axiom, thus "evolving" into a more capable successor system S_{α+1}. This action of continuous absorption of new knowledge and progressive advancement marked by ordinals (α → α+1) is **Transfinite Iteration**. Therefore, Ordinal Logic is not a single system, but an **evolutionary ladder** where trust increases exponentially with iteration count.

This profound theory finds extremely typical engineering mapping in the Bitcoin system. Although Satoshi Nakamoto did not directly use the term "transfinite iteration," his design of Proof of Work (PoW) and longest chain rules essentially perfectly embodies the same structural logic: in a system that cannot be centrally arbitrated, it is impossible to establish the "final state" of transactions at once, but through continuous addition of new blocks and chain extension, the system state continuously approaches irreversible finality.

Bitcoin's transfinite iteration manifestations include the following three points:

- **Superimposed Historical Confirmation**: Each new block generation is a confirmation of the historical chain. New blocks not only package current transactions but also reinforce all past states by referencing the hash of the previous block.
- **Exponential Depth Enhancement**: As the chain grows, the confirmation count of historical transactions also increases synchronously. Each additional block equals adding one external "proof" to existing consensus, making tampering costs increase exponentially over time.
- **Probabilistic Emergence of Finality**: The irreversibility of system state is not due to achieving complete consensus at some moment, but because transfinite iteration brings a snowball effect of confirmation depth, making the system infinitely approach safety and completeness in a probabilistic sense.

Therefore, the Bitcoin system actually adopts an engineering transfinite iteration path. PoW provides the structural verification required for each iteration (i.e., each block), while the longest chain principle forms the selection function for evolutionary paths. The entire system does not rely on a single endpoint or centralized prover, but achieves a consensus approximation mechanism in a decentralized environment through continuous evolutionary structural processes.

## 2.4 GEB Four Elements: Construction from Individual to Consensus

Based on the theoretical lineage from Gödel, Turing to Feferman outlined above, we can now propose a universal, self-evolving system theory—**GEB Four Elements**. This architecture abandons static, closed design approaches, and through the organic combination of four core elements, completely describes how a system can emerge from discrete individual states, through computation, judgment, and iteration, to ultimately emerge unified, credible macroscopic reality. This architecture directly maps from Bitcoin's engineering system and is the blueprint for theory to practice.

### **2.4.1 Element One: Individual Accounts**

- **Abstract Function**: This is the system's "elementary particle," the minimum sovereign unit carrying state and ownership. It ensures individual sovereignty independence and security through cryptography, requiring no permission or endorsement from any centralized institution, and is the cornerstone for the entire system to achieve **decentralization**. It defines "who is who" and "who owns what," and is the logical starting point for the entire system's verifiable interactions.
- **Bitcoin Mapping**: In Bitcoin, individual accounts are embodied by public-private key pairs and the UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) they control. Each UTXO is a clear, discrete value state, while the corresponding private key gives its owner absolute, exclusive control. The public key as a public account address enables any ownership declaration (signature) to be verified by the entire network. This structure provides the most basic, core verifiable state unit for the system.

### 2.4.2 Element Two: Computable Turing Machine

- **Abstract Function**: This element represents the system's "physical laws"—a set of deterministic and unambiguous rules. Its sole responsibility is to **verify** whether a state transition is "legal"; it is not responsible for **"creating"** or **"judging"** new states. Any participant in the system can independently execute these rules and consistently reach the same verification results for identical behaviors.
- **Bitcoin Mapping**: Bitcoin's **script system (Script) and various consensus rules built into full nodes** collectively constitute this computable Turing machine. When a transaction is broadcast, every node mechanically executes a series of checks: is the signature valid? Is the input amount greater than or equal to the output amount? Are the referenced UTXOs real and unspent? etc. This process is completely deterministic, ensuring that any illegal transaction will be rejected by the system, maintaining the system's basic logical self-consistency.

### 2.4.3 Element Three: Decidable Oracle Turing Machine

- **Abstract Function**: This is the system's "evolutionary engine" or "creative source." When the system faces "decision problems" that cannot be solved solely by internal deterministic rules (for example, "Among multiple legal transactions, which one should be confirmed?" or "How to establish a unique order for all transactions?"), this mechanism is responsible for introducing an "oracle judgment" from the external world, providing the system with new information necessary for continued progress.
- **Bitcoin Mapping**: Bitcoin's **Proof of Work (PoW) mining process** is precisely the ingenious engineering implementation of the Oracle Turing Machine. Facing the chaotic pending transaction pool (decision problem), miners (oracles) compete through investing real physical energy in hash competitions, ultimately producing a valid block containing a specific transaction order. This block is the "judgment" given by the oracle. The system itself cannot "compute" which miner will win, nor can it "compute" the correct transaction order, but it can receive this "candidate solution" produced by external competition and submit it to the "Computable Turing Machine" for verification.

### 2.4.4 Element Four: Transfinite Iteration

- **Abstract Function**: This is the system's "time law" and "history builder." It is responsible for weaving discrete, potentially conflicting "judgments" (i.e., candidate solutions) produced by the "Oracle Turing Machine" into a unique "history" with exponentially increasing trust over time through a continuous, progressive iteration process.
- **Bitcoin Mapping**: Bitcoin's **longest chain consensus rule** is precisely the algorithmic embodiment of transfinite iteration. Each new block link is one iteration. When forks occur (i.e., multiple oracles give conflicting judgments), all participants follow the simple rule of "continue iterating on the longest chain." Chain length (PoW condensed behind it) becomes the only measure of "credibility." As detailed in Section 2.3, this process makes transaction "finality" emerge in probabilistic form—the longer the chain, the more stable the history, and the stronger the consensus.

The GEB Four-Element theory proposed in this chapter has its core in simultaneously solving the two major problems of "decentralization" and "perceiving reality." It constructs a permissionless trust foundation through the distributed sovereignty of **individual accounts** and the decentralized arbitration of **transfinite iteration**, while also endowing the system with the ability to perceive and judge the external world through the **Oracle Turing Machine** model.

# 3. **Paradigm Leap: From BEVM(λ) to GEB**

Chapter 2 systematically expounds from the roots of mathematical logic how Turing's open system ideas address Π₂-level challenges and ultimately abstracts a theoretical model capable of "perceiving reality." This chapter will shift perspective, tracing its more direct engineering intellectual evolution lineage, revealing how the **GEB Four-Element Theory** evolved from a predecessor framework that was inspiring but trapped in abstraction—**BEVM(λ)**.

## 3.1 BEVM(λ): An Inspiring Predecessor Framework

**BEVM(λ)** is the predecessor on GEB's evolutionary path, which first attempted to systematically characterize Bitcoin's underlying logic using formal language and abstract four core components:

- **λ-calculus**: As the modeling language for state transitions and rule expression;
- **Individual model**: For characterizing the one-to-one mapping of user intentions and state ownership;
- **Consensus algorithm**: For ensuring system state verification and network-wide consistency;
- **Consensus perception mechanism**: Attempting to map off-chain energy input to on-chain value writing.

This framework was highly inspiring at the theoretical level, but the components were relatively independent, lacking organic synergistic mechanisms. It pointed out the basic elements needed to construct a decentralized system but failed to integrate them into a "living" system capable of autonomous evolution, especially encountering bottlenecks in distinguishing "determinism of rules" from "non-determinism of judgment."

## 3.2 GEB's Evolutionary Mapping: From Abstract Components to Four-Element Synergy

The GEB four-element architecture is not designed out of thin air, but is the result of **deconstruction, reorganization, and synergistic mechanism injection** of various abstract components in BEVM(λ). Through clearly dividing the responsibilities of different elements, it completes the paradigm evolution from static modeling to dynamic adaptive systems.

### 3.2.1 Individual Accounts: Deepened from the Individual Model

GEB's **individual accounts** are the engineering implementation and deepening of the `Individual` model in BEVM(λ). While the `Individual` model established the idea of ownership attribution, it remained at the abstract principle level. GEB anchors it to cryptographic structures represented by **UTXOs and public-private key pairs**, transforming abstract "ownership" into system-level, verifiable operational units, constituting the cornerstone of the entire system's decentralization.

### 3.2.2 Computable Turing Machine: Concretized from λ-calculus

GEB's **computable Turing machine** concretizes the `λ-calculus` universal computational model in BEVM(λ) into the system's "physical laws." It is no longer merely a theoretical rule description, but is implemented as a deterministic **verification engine** (such as Bitcoin scripts and consensus rules) that every node must strictly follow. Its responsibility is to answer "Is this behavior legal?" ensuring absolute logical self-consistency within the system.

### **3.2.3 Decidable Oracle Turing Machine: Restructured from Consensus Perception Mechanism**

GEB's **decidable Oracle Turing Machine** is the restructuring and implementation of the `consensus perception mechanism` in BEVM(λ). It clearly defines the vague idea of "energy input mapping value" as "decision" work completed by external competitors (oracles). Taking PoW as an example, it utilizes the asymmetry of P/NP to delegate the NP-hard solving process of finding Nonce to miners. The block produced by miners consuming energy is the external "judgment" about transaction ordering provided by the oracle to the system.

### **3.2.4 Transfinite Iteration: Dynamically Sublimated from Consensus Algorithm**

GEB's **transfinite iteration** structure solves the problem of BEVM(λ)'s `consensus algorithm` lacking dynamic evolutionary carriers. It sublimates static "consistency requirements" into a dynamic **history construction law** that achieves trust emergence. Taking the longest chain principle as an example, it defines "consensus" as a never-ending **selection process**: all nodes follow the simple rule of "continue iterating on the chain with the greatest cumulative work." Each new block addition is one iteration. Through this process, the system weaves discrete judgments produced by oracles into a unique history with exponentially increasing trust over time.

Through this restructuring, the **GEB Four-Element Theory** completed a systematic transcendence of BEVM(λ). The static, separated components in BEVM(λ) were reintegrated into a dynamically synergistic framework: the **computable Turing machine** is responsible for verification, the **Oracle Turing machine** is responsible for judgment, and both achieve perfect synergy in a system driven by **transfinite iteration** with **individual accounts** as the main body. This marks a systematic paradigm leap from "closed formal expression" to "open real-world mapping."

# 4. **GEB Engineering Architecture: A Heterogeneous Synergistic Agere Network**

After establishing theory and evolutionary paths in the first three chapters, this chapter will elaborate on the **specific engineering architecture** of the GEB system. The core of GEB's engineering architecture is a synergistic network composed of multiple heterogeneous **Agere subsystems**, which systematically restructures and transcends the "parent-child consensus" design in the original BEVM(λ).

Each Agere subsystem is a complex adaptive system with complete closed-loop capabilities built around specific real-world tasks (such as AI model training, data verification, etc.). The entire GEB architecture precisely maps the three-layer theory described in Chapter 2 into specific engineering components and workflows.

### **4.1 Individual Accounts: Account System Symbiotic with Bitcoin Network**

The cornerstone of GEB's four elements is "individual accounts," whose practical solution is to achieve native symbiosis with the most secure decentralized system in existence—the Bitcoin network.

- **Architecture Implementation: Native Address Binding**
All account addresses in the GEB system are directly derived from or associated with Bitcoin addresses. Users' identities and asset ownership are ultimately proven through the Bitcoin private keys they control.
- **Workflow: Entry Protocol**
GEB defines an "entry protocol." Users activate their participation permissions in specific Agere subsystems by constructing a special Bitcoin transaction (for example, containing specific `OP_RETURN` data) to "register" their UTXOs to the GEB network. This behavior not only activates users' participation permissions in specific Agere subsystems, but more importantly, it anchors the value and security of Bitcoin UTXOs to the GEB ecosystem in a trustless manner.
- **Structural Advantages**
This design enables GEB to naturally inherit the unparalleled security and decentralization characteristics of the Bitcoin network, providing unified, trustless digital identity and asset foundations for all upper-layer applications.

### **4.2 Computable Turing Machine: Deterministic Verification Engine**

The "computable Turing machine" in GEB's four elements—the system's "physical laws"—is implemented in engineering as each Agere subsystem's **deterministic verification engine**, usually in the form of virtual machines (VMs) or unambiguous rule sets.

- **Architecture Implementation: Agere Virtual Machine/Rule Set**
Each Agere subsystem embeds a set of clearly defined virtual machines or verification logic. Its core responsibility is to receive a "task delivery proof" (produced by Element Three) and perform deterministic, network-wide repeatable verification checks on it.
- **Workflow: Legality Verification**
When a "task delivery proof" is broadcast in the network, all nodes independently run this verification engine, checking whether its format, logic, and results meet requirements according to task-preset rules. Any delivery that does not conform to rules will be deterministically rejected by the system. This ensures absolute logical self-consistency within the system and is the direct embodiment of "closed rule verification."

### **4.3 Decidable Oracle Turing Machine: Task-Driven Perceiver Network**

In the GEB system, the theoretical role of "**Perceiver**" defined in Chapter 2 is played by specific **Agere nodes**. These nodes constitute the engineering entities of the Oracle Turing Machine, injecting external "judgments" into the system through task-driven structural competition.

- **Core Components: Task-Driven Network**
    - **Agere Nodes (i.e., Perceivers)**: As task executors, they are core participants in the GEB network, which can be servers running specific software, personal devices, or AI agents.
    - **Task Publishers**: Responsible for defining and broadcasting specific tasks to the network, such as "generate AI summaries for a set of data," "verify the authenticity of a news item," or "run a model inference," etc.
- **Workflow: Generalized Proof of Work**
    1. **Task Claiming and Execution**: Agere nodes monitor the network, claim tasks they can handle, and invest their own resources (such as model computing power, storage, bandwidth, or human intelligence) to complete tasks, generating one or more candidate solutions.
    2. **Result Encapsulation and Submission**: Nodes package results with a random Nonce and sign them, forming a "task delivery proof" and submitting it to the network. This is a generalized, non-computationally intensive "proof of work," whose "work" directly aligns with value creation activities in the real world.

This structure successfully grounds the abstract "oracle judgment" into concrete "task delivery," constructing the core engine for the system to perceive reality.

### **4.4 Transfinite Iteration: Reputation-Based Evolutionary Consensus**

GEB's transfinite iteration structure is a sublimation of the traditional "longest chain principle." It abandons single computing power weighting and adopts a more complex evolutionary consensus mechanism based on **reputation and multi-dimensional feedback**.

- **Architecture Implementation: Verifier Network and Global Reputation Layer (Agere0)**
    - **Verifier Network**: In each Agere subsystem, there exists a verifier network composed of high-reputation nodes. They are responsible for evaluating "task delivery proofs" submitted by "perceivers" (Agere nodes).
    - **Agere0 - Global Reputation Layer**: There exists a special root-level Agere subsystem in GEB—Agere0. Its core task is to serve as a global reputation center, periodically aggregating consensus results from all Agere subsystems (such as scores, node performance), and accordingly updating the global reputation values of all nodes in the network.
- **Workflow: Iteration and Evolution**
    1. **Structural Feedback**: Verification is not a simple "right/wrong" binary judgment. Verifiers will score or vote on candidate solutions according to multiple dimensions defined by tasks (such as accuracy, efficiency, originality).
    2. **Path Selection**: Within a task cycle, the "task delivery proof" with the highest comprehensive score or receiving the most verifier support is confirmed as the "winning solution." This solution is written into the Agere subsystem's state chain, becoming part of history.
    3. **Reputation Evolution**: Winning and participating nodes will receive GEB incentives and reputation adjustments based on their performance, and these adjustment results will be fed back to Agere0.

This process perfectly embodies **transfinite iteration**: every selected solution (new block) is a confirmation of history; while the feedback from the global reputation system (Agere0) acts like a higher-order observer, continuously weighting the "credibility" of the entire system's evolution, guiding consensus paths toward better (higher reputation, higher quality) directions.

# 5. GEB Application Examples: Architectural Implementation of Parallel Oracle Turing Machines

Based on the theoretical architecture established in previous chapters, GEB's core innovation lies in: it uses Bitcoin's UTXO model as a unified **identity and asset entry**, and through the two core mechanisms of **oracle judgment** and **transfinite iteration**, constructs a network composed of multiple heterogeneous, self-organizing Agere subsystems. Theoretically, each Agere subsystem is a "Oracle Turing Machine" in the Turing sense that handles specific decision problems. This chapter will use typical applications as examples to elaborate how this architecture, while sharing Bitcoin's ownership state, supports diverse consensus mechanisms, thereby constructing a parallel, infinitely expandable decentralized application ecosystem.

## 5.1 Architectural Premise: System Symbiotic Mode Sharing Bitcoin UTXO State

Unlike traditional blockchain applications, GEB does not replicate Bitcoin's chain consensus structure, but structurally **directly inherits Bitcoin's UTXO data model**. Each GEB subsystem adopts this model as its own account mechanism and introduces user sovereignty through signing behavior, achieving the first type of oracle entry for real-world input.

We call this mechanism:

> "Shared State, Separated Consensus" mode — GEB subsystems share global state sources (Bitcoin's UTXOs) but each defines task generation and arbitration paths, independent and synergistic with each other.
> 

Logically, it means each system faces problems of the following form:

$$
(∀x)(∃y) R(x,y)
$$

Where:

- x represents external input (such as voting requests, identity declarations, creation rights);
- y represents structural responses generated by the system;
- R(x, y) represents whether structural arbitration is established.

In GEB's structural semantics, each Agere system is a "Turing-Oracle subsystem" solving its specific R(x, y) problem.

## 5.2 Application Example One: BTC-RNG — Random Number Oracle

- **System Goal**: Provide various DApps with a fair, verifiable, strongly anti-manipulation decentralized random number source.
- **GEB Four-Element Mapping:**
    - **Individual Accounts**: Users use their controlled Bitcoin UTXO-associated accounts to sign, submitting random number generation tasks and paying corresponding fees. This signature transaction establishes the task's ownership and initial state, which is the logical starting point for the system to process this task.
    - **Computable Turing Machine**: This is a clearly defined, network-wide unified deterministic verification rule set. This rule set specifies the validity standards for task delivery proofs, for example: random number seeds must originate from specified Bitcoin blocks, and hash puzzle solutions must meet requirements. Any node in the network can independently run this rule set to verify submitted proofs. Since rules are deterministic, all nodes must have identical verification results for the same proof, ensuring the system's logical self-consistency and fairness.
    - **Decidable Oracle Turing Machine**: This mechanism is used to solve uncertain problems that the system cannot solve through internal computation, namely "generating a future random number." Any Agere node in the network can act as an "oracle," participating in this open competition. They invest computing power to solve hash puzzles, competing for the right to generate and submit random number proofs. The proof submitted by the winning node is providing the system with an external "judgmental input" about this uncertain problem produced by external competition.
    - **Transfinite Iteration**: This is the process of integrating individual, discrete "judgments" into the system's continuous, credible history. When a winning "proof" is accepted and recorded by network consensus, it is no longer an isolated result but becomes part of the system's state history. Each successful record is one **iteration** of the system state, which not only confirms the finality of the current task but also enhances the cumulative credibility of the entire system's historical records. Through this continuously accumulating confirmation process, the system constructs a consensus history about random number generation that can be traced and verified.
- **System Arbitration Problem R(x, y)**:

$$
(∀x∈Tasks)(∃y∈Proofs) R(x,y)
$$

Where R(x, y) represents "random number task x has a valid delivery proof y."

## 5.3 Application Example Two: BTC-DID — Dynamic Trusted Identity System

- **System Goal**: Transcend static identity authentication, constructing a decentralized reputation system capable of dynamically quantifying, evaluating, and evolving individual credibility in the network.
- **GEB Four-Element Mapping:**
    - **Individual Accounts**: Rooted in Bitcoin UTXO ownership, each user's decentralized identity (DID) is an independent unit with sovereignty proven through their controlled private keys. This is the inalienable individual sovereign foundation upon which the entire reputation system is built.
    - **Computable Turing Machine**: This is a network-wide shared, unchangeable "physical law." It precisely defines what constitutes a legal "proof" format, and more importantly, it provides the unique, public mathematical formula for calculating reputation scores. Any node, given the same "proof" data, must strictly follow this formula to calculate completely identical reputation results, ensuring the system's determinism and verifiability.
    - **Decidable Oracle Turing Machine**: This is the system's "perception" and "judgment" engine. When a user (DID) makes a "proof" for another user (for example, "this person keeps promises"), they are acting as an "oracle," injecting a subjective value judgment into the system that cannot be derived through computation. In more complex disputes, a "jury" composed of multiple high-reputation users forms a collective oracle, jointly making rulings on complex reality. These external "judgments" are the core driving force of system evolution.
    - **Transfinite Iteration**: This is the evolutionary process of weaving scattered "judgments" into credible "history." The entire reputation system is not static; it continuously iterates. Whenever a new "proof" is accepted by the network, or whenever global reputation scores are updated once, it is equivalent to history being reinforced and rewritten again, becoming more precise. Just as chains grow link by link, each iteration makes the entire system's reputation state more stable and harder to tamper with, thus emerging credible macroscopic order in dynamics.
- **System Arbitration Problem R(x, y)**:

$$
(∀x∈DIDs)(∃y∈Reports) R(x,y)
$$

Where R(x, y) represents "the reputation report y for DID x is a valid calculation result based on the current global 'proof' graph."

## 5.4 Application Example Three: BTC-Copyright — Creator Economy and Rights System

- **System Goal**: Provide creators with copyright declaration, transfer, and certification mechanisms based on Bitcoin's state structure.
- **GEB Four-Element Mapping:**
    - **Individual Accounts**: Creators bind "content hashes" (digital fingerprints of works) to their identities through their Bitcoin-associated account signatures, completing the initial declaration of ownership.
    - **Computable Turing Machine**: Defines metadata standards for copyright declarations (such as author, creation time, license agreements, etc.) and provides deterministic rules for verifying content hash and signature consistency.
    - **Decidable Oracle Turing Machine**: Agere nodes or professional institutions in the community act as "content reviewers" (oracles), making "non-deterministic" judgments on submitted works regarding originality, compliance violations, etc. This judgment process may require AI-assisted review or human expert intervention.
    - **Transfinite Iteration**: Community verification nodes vote or multi-signature confirm works that pass review. Once a work's copyright declaration is accepted and on-chained by a majority of verifiers, the first iteration is completed. Each subsequent transaction, license, or citation is a "historical reinforcement" of this initial copyright record, making the ownership path increasingly clear and solid.
- **System Arbitration Problem R(x, y)**:

$$
(∀x∈Works)(∃y∈Rights) R(x,y)
$$

Where R(x, y) represents "the rights ownership of work x is confirmed by structure y."

# 6. Conclusion: The Path to Decentralized Perceivers

To transcend the dual dilemmas of "**perceptual closure**" and "**structural centralization**" that current artificial intelligence and blockchain systems universally face due to being rooted in "single formal systems," this whitepaper proposes a completely new theoretical and engineering framework—**GEB**.

It abandons closed computational paradigms, returning to Alan Turing's profound insights in his doctoral dissertation. By combining the ideas of "**Oracle Turing Machine**" and "**Transfinite Iteration Based on Ordinal Logic**," we ultimately constructed a **GEB Four-Element Architecture** aimed at addressing Π₂-level challenges, laying a solid theoretical foundation for machines to autonomously "perceive reality."

In engineering practice, the GEB architecture is realized through a heterogeneous network called **Agere**. It uses Bitcoin's UTXO model as a unified identity and asset foundation, supporting the construction of countless parallel Agere subsystems. Each subsystem is a complete embodiment of GEB's four elements: **individual accounts** ensure the sovereign foundation of decentralization, **computable Turing machines** provide deterministic rule verification, **Oracle Turing machines** introduce external judgments through "perceivers" (Agere nodes), while **transfinite iteration** weaves these judgments into credible history through evolutionary consensus.

Finally, through a series of application examples such as BTC-RNG (random number oracle), BTC-DID (dynamic trusted identity system), and BTC-Copyright (copyright rights), we demonstrate the universality and practical capabilities of this architecture. GEB theory not only offers a profound and unified perspective for understanding the essence of Bitcoin, but, more importantly, it paves an entirely new path for building the next generation of complex adaptive systems—systems capable of continuous evolution and authentic perception of reality, realized through a network of decentralized "**perceivers**."
