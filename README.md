## Progress and Outstanding Challenges

[**Progress in this Version:**](./geb-white-paper.md)
* Deepened the analysis of the fundamental principles, capability boundaries, and inherent contradictions of blockchain systems, providing a more thorough evaluation.

**Outstanding Challenges and Future Work:**

* A key theoretical bottleneck is that the specific connection mechanism for the P vs NP problem (or related formal system interaction issues) within this framework has not yet been fully clarified.
* This theoretical bottleneck directly impacts the development of the "**Distributed Content Value Discovery Platform**" application scenario. Consequently, the drafting of the relevant sections has been postponed and will resume once a breakthrough is achieved on the theoretical front.
