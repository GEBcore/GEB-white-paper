### Abstract

Current Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain systems, built upon single formal systems, commonly face issues of **perceptual closure** and **structural centralization**: on one hand, systems struggle to effectively perceive and respond to uncertainties in the external world; on the other hand, centralized account systems prevent users from autonomously controlling their assets and data, hindering the protection of **individual sovereignty** within the system.

To overcome this dilemma, **GEB** proposes a **closed-loop architecture** composed of three types of formal systems collaborating asynchronously. The system includes:
1.  A **Consensus Formal System** for rule validation and consensus writing, forming the execution basis for trusted code.
2.  A **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) mechanism** that breaks the centralized account structure, enabling users to directly control **state units** with private keys, achieving a direct mapping between individuals and the system.
3.  A **P/NP structure** that introduces task generation and verification mechanisms, endowing the system with the ability to perceive and judge uncertainties in the real world.

Furthermore, the Consensus Formal System acts as an intermediary among the three structures, validating individual ownership states on one hand, and writing the verified results from the perceptual system into the consensus state on the other, thereby achieving dynamic connectivity and structural synergy among humans, machines, and the real world.

Under this architecture, GEB can continuously handle external inputs in open environments, achieve feedback regulation and structural evolution, ultimately providing a feasible path towards constructing **Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)** with real-world perceptual capabilities.



## **Outstanding Challenges and Future Work:**

* A key theoretical bottleneck is that the specific connection mechanism for the P vs NP problem (or related formal system interaction issues) within this framework has not yet been fully clarified.
* This theoretical bottleneck directly impacts the development of the "**Distributed Content Value Discovery Platform**" application scenario. Consequently, the drafting of the relevant sections has been postponed and will resume once a breakthrough is achieved on the theoretical front.
